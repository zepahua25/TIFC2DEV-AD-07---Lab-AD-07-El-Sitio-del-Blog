  2. Create your file structure. You will need 3 individual html files, 1 for each page of your blog website and one stlye.css file. 

  3. Link your CSS style sheet on all HTML files.

  4. Create a Nav bar that links all three individual HTML files like in the Bad_Template and make sure it is the same style on all three pages.
     - Make sure this menu is always visible when the users scroll down.

  5. Make some content up for your home page! Pictures, random text, and/or videos! Whatever you can think of.
  (ex: Blogs about dogs, with lots of pictures and videos.)
  
  6. Make a footer that can be used for all three HTML pages, make sure the style and size are the same.
